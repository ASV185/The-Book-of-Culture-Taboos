                    <h3>Avoid the Number 4 in Chinese</h3>
                    <p>
                       In China, there are various accents, and the number four in Chinese is a different accent than the word death in Chinese.
                       For this reason, the number four is avoided in phone numbers, license plates, and addresses. For addresses, the rent is less
                       if the number four is in the address, and for the number four floor, most foreigners rent the apartments in the fourth floor.

                    <p>
                      In China, there is a story behind wearing green hats and several versions. It usually means to cheat on your husband. In one version,
                      a wife made a green hat for her husband so when her husband is coming back home. Her and her lover can see him from a distance, and gives her
                      lover time to leave without her husband noticing.

                    <p>
                        You have to be careful to not use chopsticks improperly. In Chinese taboos, never leave chopsticks standing straight up in 
                        a bowl a rice. It is thought to bring bad luck as chopsticks in rice look similar to the tombstone in the graveyard.

                    <p>
                       In Chinese, the phrase for 'sharing pears' is similar in writing to 'to separate'. It is a taboo to share pears with a
                       love for this reason. A person does not want to separate from a love one.
