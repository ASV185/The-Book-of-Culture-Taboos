                    <h3>Removing Shoes in Japan</h3>
                    <p>
                        Japan has several customs and taboos, such as removing shoes before entering various places.
                        Places that are common to remove shoes are <i>tatami</i> and Japanese homes. <i>Tatami</i> rooms
                        have matting called tatami. These rooms can be expected in <i>ryokans</i> (Japanese-style inns),
                        temples, and traditional restaurants.

                    <h3>Passing Money When Paying in Japan</h3>
                    <p>
                        Money in Japan is not passed around from hand to hand. Many places have a small tray were you
                        place the money or credit cards, and if change is given, it would be place in the same small tray.
                        It is prevalent in various places such as taxis, convenience stores, restaurants, hotels and other 
                        places to use this practice.

                    <p>
                        In most cities in Japan, people stand on the left side of the escalator to leave the right side for 
                        people who have to pass quickly. The only city that is the exception to the rule is Osaka, where the
                        practice is reversed.

                    <h3>Giving Out Tips in Restaurants in Japan</h3>
                    <p>
                        It may be prevalent to give out tips in other countries, but that is not the case in Japan.
                        You do not need to give out tips in places such as restaurants, bars, or taxis. It causes confusion
                        in most scenarios except after an excellent tour. It is acceptable to give a tip for outstanding service
                        in a tour.

                    <h3>Saying 'No' in a Polite Way</h3>
                    <p>
                        In Japan, a direct 'no' can come across as too blunt or impolite. Locals tend to use softer expressions
                        to decline or refuse something instead of saying 'no', but the softer expressions should be taken as a 'no'. 
                        If this is not understood, it can cause awkward or uncomfortable situations.
