                    <h3>Do Not Wear Revealing or Inappropriate Clothing in Public</h3>
                    <p>
                        Modest attire in Egypt is considered a sign of respect for Islamic traditions and practices. It
                        is recommended to dress conservatively, especially in visiting religious sites such as mosques, churches,
                        and temples. Women have to cover shoulders, chest, and legs, and wear loose-fitting clothing. Men have to
                        wear long pants and shirts to cover their shoulders.

                    <p>
                       In Egypt, most people eat with right hand. It is considered that the left hand
                       is reserved for personal hygiene. Therefore, it is unhygienic.

                       As in other cultures, flowers as a gift are only given in some occasions. In Egypt, are meant for weddings,

                    <p>
                        In Egypt, public displays of affection are considered disrespectful because the culture in Egypt
                        is more conservative and traditional. For example, hugging and kissing in public is uncommon in Egypt.

                    <p>
                        In Egypt, and other countries individual privacy is important. With that being said, taking
                        photographs of locals without their permission can be a sign of disrespect. It can also
                        be consider harassment, and make some locals feel uncomfortable.

                    <h3>Do Not Climb on Ancient Artifacts, Pyramids, or Tombs</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are two reasons to not climbs on ancient structures. First, the ancient 
                        structures in Egypt are delicate and it is essential to handle them with care. 
                        Secondly, it can be considered disrespectful towards the Cultural Hertiage of Egypt.
