                    <h3>To Touch Someone on the Top of Their Head is Rude and Insensitive</h3>
                    <p>
                       In India, the top of someone's head is considered the most important part of the body. 
                       Therefore, it is rude and insensitive for someone to touch it especially babies, children,
                       elderly, religious leaders, or statues of deities.

                    <p>
                        You should never sit higher than an elder. If they are sitting down, you should sit down too.

                    <h3>Do Not Pass Objects with Only the Left Hand</h3>
                    <p>
                      The left hand is usually used for cleaning, and never for passing an object. You should use the right hand or 
                      both hands to pass an object.

                    <h3>Some Gifts are Inappropriate Depending on One's Religious Affiliation</h3>
                    <p>
                       You should be careful to give gifts. Some gifts are not appropriate depending on
                       someone's religious affiliation. For example, giving gifts made out of leather may
                       offend someone that is Hindu. If someone is Muslim, giving a gift related to pigs may
                       be offensive.

                        Instead, motion with your chin or extend your hand, palm flat and skyward, at the object youâ€™re referencing.

                        on the floor because it is offensive.
